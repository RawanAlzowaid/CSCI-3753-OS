1. (+12) Describe at
least 3 general approaches in memory management towards solving the external
fragmentation problem.
(+4 for each points)  


Ans:-

Three general
approaches in memory management towards solving the external fragmentation
problem can be:

1.Compacting: eliminates
all fragments in memory by moving all used memory so that it is in a contiguous
chunk. By moving all used memory to be one large chunk, there is now a large
chunk of free memory that can be used by entire process address spaces and many
more processes can now be fit in to memory.
However, this process is very expensive and complicated, and can only be done
if addresses are bound at run-time.

2. Segmentation: breaks main memory into variable size chunks. This
allows for the code, data, heap, and stack sections to all be centralized to
their own section.

3. Paging: This is the most efficient one to solve the external
fragmentation problem. When one implements paging, they divide a process into pages,
and fit individual pages into memory. This solves the external fragmentation
problem because memory is divided up into equal size memory slots and pages are
fit into these slots. Since a free memory slot is the size of a page, there is
no wasted memory. Once a process is divided into pages and fit into memory,
there is a page table kept for that process to keep track of where each page is
in memory. The page table is usually stored in RAM, making for much 
faster and less complicated accesses.

4. Worst-fit policy is also a reasonable answer, because it delays
fragmentation for the longest time.
